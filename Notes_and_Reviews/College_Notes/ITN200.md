# Using Windows Server 2019 within an Organization

### Computer networks and the Internet in the 1990s
- PCs (client) connected to other computers across a computer network
- Obtained access to shared resources

### Server: a computer that shares a resource
- On-premises servers, cloud servers, rackmount servers, blade servers

### Rack servers (1U and 2U)
- Storage area network (SAN) devices, uninterruptible power supply (UPS) devices

# Understanding Windows Server Virtualization

### Virtualization
- Process of running more than one OS at the same time on a single computer
- requires hypervisor software

### Type 2 hypervisors run on top of an existing workstation OS

### Type 1 hypervisors interact with the hardware directly
- Contain a small OS to manage the hypervisor configuration and virtual machines
- Example: Microsoft Hyper-V

### Hypervisor requirements
- hypervisor acceleration
- Second Level Address Translation (SLAT) extensions

### Virtual Machine configuration file
- Stored within a file specific to the hypervisor

### OS virtual hard disk file
- Thick provisioning: allocates fixed space for the file when created
- Thin provisioning: dynamically allocating space as needed

### On-premises and cloud OS
- Virtual machines with a virtual hard disk file hosted on a SAN within the organization or cloud data center

### Nested Virtualization
- Running other VMs within an existing VM
- Example: Hyper-V
- Provides the ability to implement a more complex virtualization structure
- Provides the ability to create a complex virtualization structure on Windows 10 PCs for learning and testing purposes

# Understanding Windows Containers

### Sandboxing
- Enclosing executed Web apps in a way that isolates them from Web apps running within other containers and the underlying OS

### Docker: Common container software

### Windows Containers: Windows server component needed to use Docker

### Kernel: Core OS component 

### Hyper-V Containers
- Provide additional performance and security features to Web apps
