### Program
- Program = instruction that a computer follows to do a task (Ex. Microsoft Word, Power point)
  - Also referred to as software, without it, a computer can do nothing
  - creators of programs = programmers or software developers

---

### Hardware
- Physical device in a computer = computer's hardware
  - Most computer systems are made with the same hardware
- Hardware = physical devices or components computer is made of, each device plays its own role

---

### Major Components
- The central processing unit (CPU)
- Main memory
  - RAM
- Secondary storage devices
- Input devices
  - Keyboards, mouse
- Output devices
  - Speakers, Printers

---

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The most important component in the computer, without it the computer can't run software
- The component that runs the program
- CPU used to be huge, now they're small and powerful chips known as Microprocessors.

---

### Main Memory
- Known as RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Stores memory and data while the program is running
- RAM is **volatile**  memory that is used only for temporary storage while the software is running.
- Computer is off = contents of RAM are erased

---

### Secondary storage devices
- memory that holds data for long periods of time, even when the computer is turned off
- Programs are usually stored in secondary memory and loaded into main memory
- important data is saved to secondary storage
- **disk drive:** the most common type of secondary storage device
  - stores data by encoding it onto a circular disk
- **Solid state drives:** stores data in solid state memory
  - no moving parts
  - operates faster than disk drive
- **External Disk Drives:** used to create backup copies of important data or move data to a different computer
  - **USB Drives** small device that plugs in to usb port
  - not a disk but can store data, in a special type of memory called **flash memory**

---

### Input Devices
- data the computer collects from people and other devices
- collects data, sends it to the computer is called input device
  - ex: keyboard, mouse, touchscreen
- disk drives and optical drives are input devices

---

### Output devices
- data the computers use to produce for people or for other devices
  - ex: printers and video displays

---

### How Computers Store Data
- memories are divided into tiny storage locations known as **bytes**
- 1 byte is only enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a number
- Computers have millions or billions of bytes of memory

- Bytes are divided into 8 smaller storage locations known as bits
  - **bit** stands for **binary digit**
  - think of bits as switches that can be turned on or off
  - bits, small electrical components that can hold a positive or negative charge

---

### Storing numbers
- A bit can be a limited way to represent numbers
- **Binary numbering system:** bit turned off = 0 turned on = 1
  - all numeric values are written as a sequence of 0s and 1s
  - ex. 10011101
- The position of each digit has a value assigned to it
  - starting with the rightmost and moving to the left
  - the values of binary digits as powers of 2
- You add the one that are positive
  - ex. 10011101 right to left 1+4+8+16+126=157

---

### Storing charecters
- Any piece of data stored in a computer's memory must be stored as binary code
  - letters and punctuation marks
- when a character is stored in memory, -> converts to a numeric code, -> stored in memory as binary code

- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):** set of 128 numeric codes, represent english letters and charecters
  - A = 65
  - When A is typed, 65 is stored in memory (as a binary code)
- **Unicode:** an extensive encoding scheme that is compatible with ASCII
  - becoming the standard character set used in the computer industry

---

### Advanced Number Storage
- Computers can store negative numbers and real numbers in memory
  - Using a technique called **two's complement**, real numbers are encoded in **floating point notation**

---

### Other types of data
- **digital:** anything that uses binary code
  - **digital data** = binary that's stored
  - **digital devices** = device that works with binary devices
  - **Pixels:** composed of tiny dots of color. Pixel = **picture element**

---

### CPU
- CPU is not a brain, its not smart
- CPU is a electronic device that is made to do specifc things and perform opertions for example:
  - Reading a piece of data from main memory
  - Adding two numbers
  - Subtracting one number from another number
  - Multiplying two numbers
  - Dividing one number by another number
  - Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another
  - Determining whether one value is equal to another value

- CPU performs an easy operation on pieces of data
- CPU has to be told what to do, and that's the purpose of the program
  - Program -> a list of instructions that causes the CPU to perform operations

- Each instruction in a program is a command that tells the CPU to perform specific operation. For Example: 10110000
- written in 0s and 1s, only the CPU can understand **machine language**
  - Machine language is always written in binary
- Machine Language instruction exsit for each operation that a CPU is capable of executing.
  - instructions that a CPU can execute is known as CPU's **instruction set**
- **fetch-decode-execute cycle** -> the process of a CPU executing the program instructions. Cycle contains 3 cycles
  - **FETCH:** first cycle is to fetch, or read, the next instruction from memory into the CPU
  - **Decode:** CPU decodes the binary code, which is the instruction that was fetched from the memory, to identify which operation is should perform
  - **EXECUTE:** The last step is to perform the operation
 
---

### From Machine Language to Assembly Language
- **Assembly Language:**
- created in the early days of computing as an alternative to machine learning.
- uses binary code for instruction, assembly languag uses words known as **mnemonics**
  - ex. mnemonic ass mean to add numbers, mu1 means to multiply, mov means to move a value to a laction in memory,
- Programmers use assembly language to write programs
- write short mnemonics instead of long binary codes
- Assembly languag programs cannot be performed by the CPU
- **Assembeler** was made so it could translate assembly language program to a machine language program

---

## High Level Languages
- Assembly is referred to as a **low-level language**, due to it being close in nature to machine language

- **High Level Programs** apeared in the 1950s. allows you to create powerful and complex programs without needing to know how the CPU works or write large, low-level instructions.
- most high-level uses words that are easy
- In COBOL earliest high level, the programmer would just instruct it to display Hello World
```bash
Display "Hello World"
```
- Doing this in assembly language would require several instructions and knowledge of how the CPU works
- High level allows us to concentrate on the task we want to perform.
- Each high level has its own set of words that you must learn to understand
  - these are known as **key words** or **reserved words**
- each language has its own **syntax**
  - syntax = rules that must be strictly followed when writing a program
- Syntax rules dictate how keywords, operators, and various punctuation must be used in a program
- When learning a language, you must know the syntax rule for that specific language
- Individual instructions in a high-level language are called **statements**
  - statements consist of keywords, operators, punctuation, and other programming elements

---

### Compilers and Interpreters
- Once a program is written in a high-level language, it must be translated. Using a compiler or an interpreter to translate, for the CPU to understand
  - **Compiler:** A Program that translates high-level program 
  - **Interpreter:** both translates and executes the instructions of the high-level program

- Statements written in a high level are called **source code** or **code**
- **syntax error** is a mistake, such as a misspelled keyword, operator, or punctuation

---

### Types of Software
- System software
  - The set of programs that control or enhance the operation of a computer such as an Operating System, Utility Programs, or Software Development Tools.
- Application software
  - Programs that make a computer useful for every day tasks such as Microsoft Word, email programs, and Web browsers.

### Designing a Program
- programs should be carefully designed before written
  - design process = pseudocode and flowchart
- syntax of each language must be followed when writing code
  - syntax error -> compiler or interpreter will display error message
    - Why? simple mistakes, misspelled keywords, operator, punctuation
- once fixed the program will be compiled and translated
- code is an executable form -> tested for **logic errors**
  - logic errors lets the program run, but causes inccorect results
  - How to fix it? **debug** the code, which means the programmer finds and corrects the code that is causing the issue. Sometimes, the orginal design must be changed.
  - **Program Development cycle:** repeat until there are no errors found in the program
 
- two steps of designing a program
  - understand the task that the program is to perform
    - understanding what a program is supposed to do, we gain this understanding through our **customer**
  - Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task
    - creating an algorithm or a plan
    - commonly use two tools to plan: pseudocode and flowcharts

- **Pseudocode**
- Pseudocode = fake code
- no syntax rule
  - not meant to be compiled or executed
- Meant to create models or mock-ups of programs
- once a good design has been created, it can be translated to actual code

- **Flow Charts**
- The diagram shows the steps that take place in a program
- 3 symbols
  - Ovals: **Terminal symbols**
  - Parallelogram: **input** and **output**
  - Rectangle: **processing symbols**
- **Connector Symbol**
- sometimes flow chart too long, you can break it into two smaller flow charts
- **Connector Symbols** -> connects the two flow chart, alwyas a small cirlce with a symbol or letter.
- **Off-page connecter**
- a home plate symbol that shows you the number inside it.

---

### Output, input, and Variable
- 3-step computer programs follow
- Input is received
- Some process is performed on the input
- output is produced

---

### IPO Charts
- effective toll programs use while designing programs
- IPO = Input Processing and Outpuy
- Charts are usually laid out in columns

---
 
### Displaying Screen output
- Display to write pseudocode statements for displaying output on the screen
```bash
Display "Hello world"
```
- The purpose of this statement to show Hello world
- quotation marks the beginning and the end of the test we want to display

---

### Sequence Structure
- set of statements that execute in the order that they appear
- **Structure** also called **control structure**: Logical design that controls the order in which a set of statements executes.

---

### Strings and String Literals
- **String** -> sequence of characters that is used as data
- **String Literal** -> when a string appears in the actual code of a program
  - usually enclosed in quotation marks ""
- Most programs use ' as quotation marks

---
  
### Variables and Input
- Variables are used to store data in memory
- **Variable** -> storage location in memory thaat is represented by a name
- Pseudocode we read data from the keyboard with the `Input` statement
```bash
Input hours
```
- `Input` -> read a piece of data from the keyboard
- `hours` -> name of the variable in which data will be stored
```bash
Display "What is your age?"
Input age
Display "Here is the value that you entered:"
Display age
```

```bash
What is you age?
24
Here is the value you entered:
24
```
- Typing you age in line 2 will display in line 4 you age 

---

### Variable Names
- Must be one word
- cannot contain spaces
- Punctuation cannot be used
- first character cannot be a number
- Since we cant use space and you cant conjoin multiple words into one we use underscore for example caesarsalad would be caesar_salad

- **camelCase** -> begin writing in lower case -> first character of the second and next words are upper case
  - ex: payRate

---

### Displaying Multiple Items with One Display Statement

```bash
Display "What is your age?"
Input age
Display "Here is the value that you entered:"
Display age
```
- Programming languages provide a way to show multiple pieces of data in one statement

```bash
1  Display “What is your age?”
2  Input age
3  Display “Here is the value that you entered: ”, age
```

```bash
What is your age?
24 [Enter]
Here is the value that you entered: 24
```
- using the space before the quotation mark allowed us to display value entered 24 on line 3

---

### String Input
- uses two Input statements: one to read a string and one to read a number.

```bash
1  Display "Enter your name."
2  Input name
3  Display "Enter your age."
4  Input age
5  Display "Hello ", name
6  Display "You are ", age, " years old."
```

```bash
Enter your name.
Andrea [Enter]
Enter your age.
24 [Enter]
Hello Andrea
You are 24 years old.
```

---

### Prompting the User
- two step process of getting keyboard input from the user
  1. Display a prompt on the screen
  2. read a value from the keyboard
- **Prompt** = message that tells the user to enter a specific value
  - ex: either their age in the following statement
- you should write a statement just before it that tells the user what to enter
- You want your program to be **user-friendly** 

---

### Variable Assignment and Calculation
- You can write statemnets that store specific values in variables
```bash
Set price = 20
```
- this is called **assignment statement**
  - Sets a variable to a specified value
- the variable price is set to the value of 20
- assignment statement in pseudocode, we write the word `Set`, followed by the name of the variable, followed by an equal sign (=), then by the value we want to store in the variable
- Variable -> they can hold different values while a program is running
- once setting a variable to a value, the value will remain in the variable until you store a different value in the variable.

```bash
1  Set dollars = 2.75
2  Display "I have ", dollars, " in my account."
3  Set dollars = 99.95
4  Display "But now I have ", dollars, " in my account!"
```

```bash
I have 2.75 in my account.
But now I have 99.95 in my account!
```

- This code shows two important characteristics of variables
  - variable holds only one value at a time
  - when storing a value in a variable, that value replaces the previous value that was in the variable

---

### Performing Calculations
- Programmer tools for performing calculations as a **math operator**
  - common math operator
    - +
    - -
    - *
    - /
    - MOD = Modulus -> divides one number by another and gives the remainder
    - ^ = exponent
- Programmers use operators to create **math expressions**
  - **math expressions:** Performs a calculation and gives a value
    - ex: 12 + 2
      - values on the left and right of the + are called **operands**
- Variables may also be used in math expressions
  - Ex. `hours * payRate`
- when using math expressions to calculate value, we want to save that value in memory so we can use it again in the program.

```bash
1  Set price = 100
2  Set discount = 20
3  Set sale = price – discount
4  Display "The total cost is $", sale
```

```bash
The total cost is $80
```

---

### Variable Declaration and Data Types
- Most program languages require you to **declare** all of the variables you intend to use in a program
- **Variable Declaration** -> statement that specifies two thing about a variable
  - Variable's name
  - Variable's data type
- Variable **data type** -> the type of data that the variable will hold
- data types depend on the programming language
  - java provides 4 data types fron integers, 2 for real numbers, 1 for strings
- only use 3 data types
  - `Integer` -> can hold whole numbers. ex: 0, -99
  - `Real` -> whole numbers or numbers with fraction part. ex: 3.0, -87.95
  - `String` -> can hold any string of characters, such as name, address, password, and so on.

- `Declare`
- `Declare Integer length`
- `Declare Real grossPay`
- `Declare String name`

---

### Declaring Variables Before using them
- Variable declaration -> tell the compiler or interpreter, you plan to use a variable in the program
  - causes the variable to be created in memory
  - you have to write the declaration **before** any other statement

```bash
1  Declare Integer age
2  Display "What is your age?"
3  Input age
4  Display "Here is the value that you entered:"
5  Display age
```

---

### Variable Initialization
- **Initialization** -> optionally assign a value to it in the declaration statement

```bash
Declare Real price = 49.95
```

---

### Uninitialized Variables
- **Uninitialized Variables** -> variable that has been declared but not initialized or assigned a value. common logical errors in programs.

```bash
Declare Real dollars
Display "I have ", dollars, " in my account."
```
- we declared the dollars variable, but we didn't initialize it or assign a value to it -> we don't know what value the variable holds

---

### Numeric Literals and Data Type Compatibility
- **Numeric Literal:** number that is written into a programs code
  - written with a decimal point
  - stored as a `Real`
  - whole number will be stored as an `Integer`
 
---

### Integer Division
- Calculator: 3/2 = 1.5
- Programming: 3/2 = 1
  - This is called **truncation** when the program throws away the fraction part

---

### Named Constants
- **Named constants**: name that represents a value that cannot be changed during the program's execution

```bash
Constant Real INTEREST_RATE = 0.069
```
- this makes a constant name INTEREST_RATES
- constants vlaue is `REAL` number 0.069
- making constant names uppercase makes it easily distinguishable from regular variable names
- Advantages of using constants: they make programs self-explanatory

```bash
Set amount = balance * 0.069
```
can be changed to 

```bash
Set amount = balance * INTEREST_RATE
```

- lets say interest rates go up 7,2 percent we can change the declaration to

```bash
Constant Real INTEREST_RATE = 0.072
```

---

### Hand Tracing a Program
- **Hand Tracing** -> debugging process for locating hard-to-find errors in a program
  - also known as **deck checking**
- you mkae a chart that has a column for each vairable and a row for each line in the program

---

### Documenting a Program
- **external Documentation** -> describes aspects of the program for the user
  - reference guides that describe program's features, and tutorials that teach users how to operate the program
- **Internal Documentation** -> for the programmer, and explains how parts of the program work
  - appears as comments in a program's code
    - ignored by the compiler and interpreter but they are critical part of a program
    - inteneded for human readers
    - ex:
```bash
// Get the number of hours worked.
// This program calculates an employee's gross pay.
// Written by Kiran Sharma.
// Last modified on 12/14/2021
```
### 2 types of comments
- Block comments: long written comments explaining the program
- line comments: comments that occupy a single line, and explain a short section of the program.

---

### Designing Your first Program
- Calculate the batting average for any player
- Determine what is required for each phase of the program:
1. What must be read as input?
2. What will be done with the input?
3. What will be the output?

1. Input is received.
– The number of hits
– The number of times at bat
2. Some process is performed on the input.
– Calculate the batting average
– Divide the number of hits by the number of times at
bat
3. Output is produced.
– The player’s batting average

- Summary
– Input
  - Determine data needed for input
  - Choose variables to store the input
– Process
  - Determine calculations to be performed
  - Choose variables to store the calculations
– Output
  - Determine what output the program will display
  - Usually the results of the program’s calculations

---

### Focus on Languages: Java, Python, and C++

```bash
public class Simple
{

}
```
- `public` and `class` key word in java
- `Simple` name of the class
- if public and class were written in uppercase it'd give you an error
- Simple is uppercase -> it is not a keyword in the java language
  - not required to use an uppercase, but standard practice just to make is distinguishable
- class name must be the same as the name of the file that class is stored in
  - file should be name Simple.java
- Curly Braces {} are meant to enclos things. they'll enclose all the code written inside the class.
- inside curly braces you must write the definition of a method named `main`.

```bash
public class Simple
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {

   }
}
```

- first line which is called the method header, begins with the words public static void main and so forth

---

Displaying Screen Output
– System.out.println()
Displays a line of output, then advances the output cursor to the next line.

```bash
public class Output
{
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
  System.out.println("My major is Computer Science.");
  System.out.println("I plan to be a software developer.");
  System.out.println("Programming is fun!");
 }
}
```

```bash
Program Output
My major is Computer Science.
I plan to be a software developer.
Programming is fun!
```

---

### Python

Displaying Screen Output
– print() function
Displays a line of output, then advances the output cursor to the next line.

```bash
print('My major is Computer Science.');
print('I plan to be a software developer.');
print('Programming is fun!');
```

```bash
Program Output
My major is Computer Science.
I plan to be a software developer.
Programming is fun!
```

---

- You do not declare variables in Python.
- Instead, you use an assignment statement to create a variable.
- age = 25
- title = 'Vice President'

---

- Pass multiple arguments to the print function, and Python will print each argument's value on the screen, separated by a space.

```bash
age = 25
print('I am', age, 'years old.');
```

```bash
Program Output
I am 25 years old.
```

---

- Reading Keyboard Input (reading a string)

```bash
first_name = input('Enter your first name: ')
last_name = input('Enter your last name: ')
print('Hello', first_name, last_name)
```

```bash
Program Output
Enter your first name: Vinny [Enter]
Enter your last name: Brown [Enter]
Hello Vinny Brown
```

---
- Reading Keyboard Input (reading an integer)

```bash
hours = int(input('How many hours did you work? '))
print('Here is the value that you entered:', hours)
```

```bash
Program Output
How many hours did you work? 40 [Enter]
Here is the value that you entered: 40
```

---

- Reading Keyboard Input (reading a real number)

```bash 
pay_rate = float(input('What is your hourly pay rate? '))
print('Here is the value that you entered:', pay_rate)
```

```bash
What is your hourly pay rate? 20 [Enter]
Here is the value that you entered: 20
```
