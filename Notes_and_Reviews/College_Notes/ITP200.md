### Program
- Program = instruction that a computer follows to do a task (Ex. Microsoft Word, Power point)
  - Also referred to as software, without it, a computer can do nothing
  - creators of programs = programmers or software developers

---

### Hardware
- Physical device in a computer = computer's hardware
  - Most computer systems are made with the same hardware
- Hardware = physical devices or components computer is made of, each device plays its own role

---

### Major Components
- The central processing unit (CPU)
- Main memory
  - RAM
- Secondary storage devices
- Input devices
  - Keyboards, mouse
- Output devices
  - Speakers, Printers

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The most important component in the computer, without it the computer can't run software
- The component that runs the program
- CPU used to be huge, now they're small and powerful chips known as Microprocessors.

---

### Main Memory
- Known as RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Stores memory and data while the program is running
- RAM is **volatile**  memory that is used only for temporary storage while the software is running.
- Computer is off = contents of RAM are erased

---

### Secondary storage devices
- memory that holds data for long periods of time, even when the computer is turned off
- Programs are usually stored in secondary memory and loaded into main memory
- important data is saved to secondary storage
- **disk drive:** the most common type of secondary storage device
  - stores data by encoding it onto a circular disk
- **Solid state drives:** stores data in solid state memory
  - no moving parts
  - operates faster than disk drive
- **External Disk Drives:** used to create backup copies of important data or move data to a different computer
  - **USB Drives** small device that plugs in to usb port
  - not a disk but can store data, in a special type of memory called **flash memory**

### Input Devices
- data the computer collects from people and other devices
- collects data, sends it to the computer is called input device
  - ex: keyboard, mouse, touchscreen
- disk drives and optical drives are input devices

---

### Output devices
- data the computers use to produce for people or for other devices
  - ex: printers and video displays

---

### How Computers Store Data
- memories are divided into tiny storage locations known as **bytes**
- 1 byte is only enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a number
- Computers have millions or billions of bytes of memory

- Bytes are divided into 8 smaller storage locations known as bits
  - **bit** stands for **binary digit**
  - think of bits as switches that can be turned on or off
  - bits, small electrical components that can hold a positive or negative charge

---

### Storing numbers
- A bit can be a limited way to represent numbers
- **Binary numbering system:** bit turned off = 0 turned on = 1
  - all numeric values are written as a sequence of 0s and 1s
  - ex. 10011101
- The position of each digit has a value assigned to it
  - starting with the rightmost and moving to the left
  - the values of binary digits as powers of 2
- You add the one that are positive
  - ex. 10011101 right to left 1+4+8+16+126=157

### Storing charecters
- Any piece of data stored in a computer's memory must be stored as binary code
  - letters and punctuation marks
- when a character is stored in memory, -> converts to a numeric code, -> stored in memory as binary code

- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):** set of 128 numeric codes, represent english letters and charecters
  - A = 65
  - When A is typed, 65 is stored in memory (as a binary code)
- **Unicode:** an extensive encoding scheme that is compatible with ASCII
  - becoming the standard character set used in the computer industry

---

### Advanced Number Storage
- Computers can store negative numbers and real numbers in memory
  - Using a technique called **two's complement**, real numbers are encoded in **floating point notation**

---

### Other types of data
- **digital:** anything that uses binary code
  - **digital data** = binary that's stored
  - **digital devices** = device that works with binary devices
  - **Pixels:** composed of tiny dots of color. Pixel = **picture element**

### CPU
- CPU is not a brain, its not smart
- CPU is a electronic device that is made to do specifc things and perform opertions for example:
  - Reading a piece of data from main memory
  - Adding two numbers
  - Subtracting one number from another number
  - Multiplying two numbers
  - Dividing one number by another number
  - Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another
  - Determining whether one value is equal to another value

- CPU performs an easy operation on pieces of data
- CPU has to be told what to do, and that's the purpose of the program
  - Program -> a list of instructions that causes the CPU to perform operations

- Each instruction in a program is a command that tells the CPU to perform specific operation. For Example: 10110000
- written in 0s and 1s, only the CPU can understand **machine language**
  - Machine language is always written in binary
- Machine Language instruction exsit for each operation that a CPU is capable of executing.
  - instructions that a CPU can execute is known as CPU's **instruction set**
- **fetch-decode-execute cycle** -> the process of a CPU executing the program instructions. Cycle contains 3 cycles
  - **FETCH:** first cycle is to fetch, or read, the next instruction from memory into the CPU
  - **Decode:** CPU decodes the binary code, which is the instruction that was fetched from the memory, to identify which operation is should perform
  - **EXECUTE:** The last step is to perform the operation

### From Machine Language to Assembly Language
- **Assembly Language:**
- created in the early days of computing as an alternative to machine learning.
- uses binary code for instruction, assembly languag uses words known as **mnemonics**
  - ex. mnemonic ass mean to add numbers, mu1 means to multiply, mov means to move a value to a laction in memory,
- Programmers use assembly language to write programs
- write short mnemonics instead of long binary codes
- Assembly languag programs cannot be performed by the CPU
- **Assembeler** was made so it could translate assembly language program to a machine language program

---

## High Level Languages
- Assembly is referred to as a **low-level language**, due to it being close in nature to machine language

- **High Level Programs** apeared in the 1950s. allows you to create powerful and complex programs without needing to know how the CPU works or write large, low-level instructions.
- most high-level uses words that are easy
- In COBOL earliest high level, the programmer would just instruct it to display Hello World
```bash
Display "Hello World"
```
- Doing this in assembly language would require several instructions and knowledge of how the CPU works
- High level allows us to concentrate on the task we want to perform.
- Each high level has its own set of words that you must learn to understand
  - these are known as **key words** or **reserved words**
- each language has its own **syntax**
  - syntax = rules that must be strictly followed when writing a program
- Syntax rules dictate how keywords, operators, and various punctuation must be used in a program
- When learning a language, you must know the syntax rule for that specific language
- Individual instructions in a high-level language are called **statements**
  - statements consist of keywords, operators, punctuation, and other programming elements

---

### Compilers and Interpreters
- Once a program is written in a high-level language, it must be translated. Using a compiler or an interpreter to translate, for the CPU to understand
  - **Compiler:** A Program that translates high-level program 
  - **Interpreter:** both translates and executes the instructions of the high-level program

- Statements written in a high level are called **source code** or **code**
- **syntax error** is a mistake, such as a misspelled keyword, operator, or punctuation

---

### Types of Software
- System software
  - The set of programs that control or enhance the operation of a computer such as an Operating System, Utility Programs, or Software Development Tools.
- Application software
  - Programs that make a computer useful for every day tasks such as Microsoft Word, email programs, and Web browsers.
