# Possession, Ownership, and Control
- Personal laptop = We possess it, we own it
- Company laptop = we possess it, we don't own it, our control depends on the organization
- Cell phone = we possess it, we own it, we don't control it since carriers, vendors, and app developers conrtol it

--- 

### Example of Control
- Phones can be vulnerable
- Vendors like Google and Apple try to block malware
  - Some malware creeps in anyway
 
- Free apps sell user data to 3rd parties or show ads

- track your location, recieve personal data
- apple blocks MAC address access by apps

### Making security decisions
- Car door = usually locked
- Room door = sometimes locked
- house door = Always locked

- Rule-based decision - following a standard
- Relativistic decision - copy others behavior
- Risk assessment - weighing the risk vs benefits

---

### Decision-making strategies
- Relativistic = my friend or someone I trust does it, I have to do it
- Risk Assessment = outweighing the benefits vs. risk

---

### Decision making in a life cycle

- Security Decisions
  - are there any weaknesses?
  - what security measures might work?
  - what are the downsides of this?
- Measure success
  - check for attacks or failures
  - recover from problems

  ---

### Risk Management Framework
- Prepare:
  - Define scope, context, priorities, resources
  - managing risk
 
- Categorize the information system:
  - Identifying goals, security risks, and requirements
 
- Select Security Controls:
  - identify existing controls, and additional ones are required

- implement security controls:
  - Construct the system containing the controls
 
- Assess security controls:
  - Verify the control works
 
- Authorize the information system:
  - approve the system for operation and use it
 
- monitor security controls:
  - watch and address security incidents
  - Review the environment for chages that affect security

### RMF Risk Assessment
- Rule Based -> US Federal standards and guidelines
- Identify RMF Categories -> sees the impact of cybersecurity failures
- Impact in terms of **CIA Properties**: Confidentiality, Intergrity, Availability
- Assess each in terms of impact
  - Low = some impact
  - High = Major damage
 
---

### Example of RMF Categorizations
- First Website shows public information: Selling widgets
  - Confidentiality: public information, so it's not applicable
  - Integrity: Low, since a site outage will not prevent customer sales
  - Availability: also low, site outage doesnt prevent customer sales
 
- Second Website shows public information: Selling widgets
  - Confidentiality: Moderate, since the website handles some electronic payment information from customers.
  - Integrity: Moderate, since the website handles some electronic payment information from customers, it specifies product prices, and it directs product shipments.
  - Availability: Moderate, since an interruption would visibly affect sales, but would not cause long-term damage to the company.
 
  ---

  ### RMF Uses Rules to Assign Controls
- Published rules recommend controls
  - NIST Special Publication 800-53
  - Add controls as impact increases

- Big vs small environments
  - Big business would absorb noticeable events
  - One event could destroy a small company

- RMF rules aren't geared for smaller buisnesses

---

### Do All Enterprises Do All RMF Steps?
- Prepare – NO, too often this is all ad hoc
- Categorize – NO, smaller ones do it differently
- Identify risks, threats, and requirements
- Select controls – YES, but a small enterprise
  - Combines with the Implement step
- Implement controls – YES
- Assess controls – YES
  - Determine if the controls really work
- Authorize system – NO, not in small enterprises
- Monitor controls – NO, not small enterprises

--- 

### Proprietor’s RMF

- Establish system and security goals = identify system's goals, secuitry risk, and requirements;
  - We perform risk assessment and make a list of security requirements
 
- Select security controls = identify existing controls and additional ones required and make the system containing the controls
  -  Use the security requirements to know the controls we need

- Validate the Information Sytem = check the control work as required, approce the system for operation, and use it
  - we test system control against the security requirments to ensure that we address out risk

- Monitor Security controls = look out for security incidents and address them, also check the environment for changes that affect security.
  - The system must have security controls that keep record of ssecurity-relevantoperations and incidents

---

### PRMF Risk Assessment

- Less elaborate process than RMF
  - inscribes the special cases of small businesses and nongovernment organizations
- PRMF Step A performs the assessment

- 3 major parts
  1. identify risk: assets, threat agents, attacks
  2. Prioritize risk: Estimate relative impacts
  3. Establish requirements: identify security goals to address the highest-priority risks

- Identifying risks
  - Step 1: Identify assets
  - Step 2: Identify threat actors and attacks
- Prioritizing risks
  - Step 3: Estimate the likelihood of attacks
  - Step 4: Estimate the impact of attacks
  - Step 5: Calculate their relative significance
- Establish requirements
  - Step 6: Write requirements to address the highest-priority risks

---

### Terminology
- Assets are protected by a boundary
- Openings in the boundary are vulnerabilities
- Attack surface represents the total of assets and the function
- A threat actor or attacker tries to attack assets
- Attack vector represents a method that a threat actor will use to attack anasset
- A defense, safeguard, or countermeasure protects the assets
- An attacked system that is unsafe to use is a compromised system
- Compromised systems on a network (or on many networks), all controlled by a single attacker, is a Botnet

---

### What are we protecting?
- for a small business
- How do we assess a boundary?
1. Can a threat actor breach a wall?
2. How do we control doorways?
3. How can a threat agent pass through a doorway?
4. How much do we trust those inside the boundary (the insider threat)?

--- 

### Least Privilege: A Basic Principle
- Restrict what people may do to an asset
- Provide the minimum privileges required
- Example: key opens my store but not yours

---

### Defense in Depth: Another Principle
- Improve security by making layers of defense
  - attackers must attack a lot of defenses to reach our valuable asset
 
- example:
- Layer 1: A robber might enter through the outer door
  - The door is locked when the store is closed
 
- Layer 2: Robber must enter the office area
  - only the manager can unlock the office

---

### Threat Actors
- Thinks about the people who perform attacks
- we can use published info to produce written profiles of specific groups that represent threat agents

---

### Examples of Specific Threat Actors
- Cyber-criminals: Kevin Mitnick, Jerry Schneider
- Criminal organizations
  - Forums used in cyber crime activities
  - Groups operating identified botnets
  - Vendors of software used in cyber crime
- Independent cybercriminal groups
  - Anonymous, Clop, Lazarus Group, LulzSec
- National actors

---

### National Actors
- Government Intelligence agencies = NCA, GCHQ

---

### Profiling a Threat Actor
- What are their goal?
- Their mode of operation (MO)
- Their motivations
- capabilities and logistical constraints

---

### Threat actor goals
- clout
- money
- overthrow a government?
- ideological victory?

--- 

### Typical MO 
- How targets are selected
- how operations are organized
- either broadly targeted attacks or a specific target
- individual or multiple coordianted attacks
- remote, onsite, insider, social engineering attacks

---

### Level of Motivation
- Unmotivated
- Scant = exploiting minor vulnerabilities
- Stealth = appliest effort, but avoids social stigma
- Low = causes harm and limited damage to assets
- Moderate = cause significant damage to assets or some injury to persons, but not critical injurties
- High = will cause significant disruption and/or critical injuries to achieve their goals

---

### Capabilities and Logistical Constraints
- Size of team, financial resources
- Geographical limitations and extradition considerations
- Does their training or skills affect their target choices?
- Are their activities simple in structure or complicated?

---

### Attacks and Risk
- Vulnerabilities make an attack possible
- threat actors implement attacks
- During an attack, threat actors attack, causing damage to one of your assets
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities
- A risk is an attack that is a likely to occur against an asset of value, and should always be worth protecting against

---

### Types of Attacks
1. Physical attack - availability attack
2. Denial of Service - availability
3. Subversion - modifying a system to work for the threat actor\
4. Masquerade - the system works on behalf of the wrong user
5. Disclosure - an attack confidentiality
6. Forgery - bogus message given to computers

---

### Terminology: “CIA” Properties
- Confidentiality
  - Keeping information secret
  - Avoiding disclosure vulnerabilities
- Integrity
  - Protecting information from improper charges
  - Avoiding forgery, subversion, and masquerade attacks
- Availability
  - Keeping systems available and in operation
  - Avoiding Denial of Service (DOS) attacks

---

### Identifying and Prioritizng Risks
- identifying risks
  - Step 1: Identify assets
  - Step 2: Identify threat actors and attacks
- Prioritizing risks
  - Step 3: Estimate the likelihood of attacks
  - Step 4: Estimate the impact of attacks
  - Step 5: Calculate their relative significance

---

### Assets
- Computer hardware and software
- Software recovery disks
- Computer customization
- Spreadsheets
- Online business and credentials
- Social media accounts and credentials

### Step 2: Identify Threats and Attacks
- Identify threat actors
  - Use assets and known attacks to guide you
- Create an attack matrix (optional)
  - Uses generic attack types to help identify more specific attacks the actors might perform
- Create a risk matrix
  - Lists likely attacks against specific assets

---

### Ethical Issues in Security Analysis
- This poses two problems
  - Is the search potentially damaging or illegal?
  - If a vulnerability is found, how do we handle the information?
- Possible cases of finding vulnerabilities
  - A search authorized by the system’s owner
  - An unauthorized search
  - An unplanned – and unexpected – discovery
